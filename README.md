# nft-bitmap[WIP]

![goldblum-quote.jpeg](docs%2Fpublic%2Fgoldblum-quote.jpeg)

Stores a bitmap in GlobalStorage. The bitmap is stored as bytes/string (same thing). The bitmap is indexed by a key, which is represented as uint64.

Since it uses GlobalStorage, it's limited to 64 keys/rows(same thing)
